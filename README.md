# Express PostgreSQL Template

This template is designed for the beginners, the learners, and the curious individuals who want to learn the basics of building a database for their projects with Express.js and PostgreSQL.

## Motivation

This small project was inspired by an article that I am writing, How to Side Project (link to this article will be posted once published). I wanted to help those who started their journey in the tech industry to understand the very basics of building a database for their side projects without learning a new programming language.
